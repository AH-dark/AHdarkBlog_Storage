# AHdark Blog Storage

**Thanks for the help and advice from [@topjohncian](https://github.com/topjohncian), I was able to continue this project and add features.**

[**AHdark Blog Storage**](https://cdn.ahdark.com) is a dedicated site for storing static files and attachments of [**
AHdark Blog**](https://ahdark.com).

In order to show it better, I developed a set of static sites for it and placed it on its homepage.

This static page uses **React**, **React-DOM**, **Material-UI**

You can check the effect at <https://cdn.ahdark.com>

## Configuration

**Please use the ```master``` branch**

* Please check ```/src/config.tsx``` for basic configuration
* Please check ```/src/gitalk.tsx``` for Gitalk Module configuration

> I suggest you to modify the source code after Fork instead of the simple configuration file.

## Content

For specific use, please consult [AHdark](https://ahdark.com/contact)

#### **If you think the code has a little bit good, just a Star please, thanks!**

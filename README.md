# AHdark Blog Storage

[**AHdark Blog Storage**](https://cdn.ahdark.com) is a dedicated site for storing static files and attachments of [**AHdark Blog**](https://ahdark.com). 

In order to show it better, I developed a set of static sites for it and placed it on its homepage.

This static page uses **React**, **React-DOM**, **Material-UI**

You can check the effect at <https://cdn.ahdark.com>

## Configuration

 * Please check ```/src/config.jsx``` for basic configuration
 * Please check ```/src/gitalk.config.jsx``` for Gitalk Module configuration   

> I suggest you to modify the source code after Fork instead of the simple configuration file.

## Content

For specific use, please consult [AHdark](https://ahdark.com/contact)


#### **If you think the code has a little bit good, just a Star please, thanks!**
